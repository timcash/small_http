# small_http 初心
## Motivation
1. This system is designed to be readable and hackable.
1. Framworks import so many tools and technologies that they form islands of code. Hiding the underlying simplicity.
1. To have a small piece of code to learn about networking and the http (protocol)

## Non-features
A small set of tools to get started with a nodejs http server. More like a template.
1. server uses `node:http`
1. great for learning about testing and http servers at a lower level
1. easy to inspect and modify the raw streams
1. testing uses the built in `node:test` and `undici` for requests for compatibility with other runtimes
1. examples of async and stream styles in a running server (node.js superpower)

# install
install npm if needed
```sh
npm install
```
# test
run the test suite in watch mode
```sh
npm test
```
# Completed PRs
1. ✅ HTTP Only Cookie example

# Looking for PRs 
1. Improve clarity of docs. 
1. Start a `mods` folder that can add `websockets` and `sse`.
1. Add html page examples for `forms` and `uploads`.
1. Add autoreload when a page changes

# external test tools
Including a few external testing tools to help learn about the larger web ecosystem and popular testing strategies.
