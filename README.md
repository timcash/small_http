# small_http
## Motivation
Other framworks and tools import so many tools and technologies that they form islands of code. typescript, jest, react, webpack, etc... we can do more with less code.
## Non-features
A small set of tools to get started with a nodejs http server. More like a template.
1. server uses `node:http`
1. great for learning about testing and http servers at a lower level
1. easy to inspect and modify the raw streams
1. testing uses the built in `node:test` and `undici` for requests
1. examples of async and stream styles in a running server (node.js superpower)

# install
install npm if needed
```sh
npm install
```
# test
run the test suite in watch mode
```sh
npm test
```

# Looking for PRs 
1. Help make things more clear and help with docs. 
1. Start a `mods` folder that can add `websockets` and `sse`.
1. Add html page examples for `forms` and `uploads`.
1. Add autoreload when a page changes
1. HTTP Only Cookie example
